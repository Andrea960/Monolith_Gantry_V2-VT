## Changelog
### April 2024 (minor QOL update)
- backwards comppatible
- less confusing **showroom style CAD** to aid assembly and help with integration
- **top rail versions are now phased out**, removed the mirrored CD parts (simplified BOM)
- **double shear bearing support is now standard** and possible with short shafted motors on 6mm 2WD and 6mm V2 AWD configs (6mm tensioner body reprint is needed to gain clearance) Trident 6mm AWD will need at least one long shafted stepper to clear the left front leadscrew. 
- **XY joints now have the double screw side on top** by default for better X endstop support, but they still can be flipped to gain clearance for low extruder motors
- all versions have the **Y endstop on the right** by default
- **top motors and top Z joints are preferred** where possible (less heat from the bed, better frame bracing options under the Z rails on V2)
- **tweaked pin lengths** for a more uniform look, no M3 standoffs in the BOM (all previous BOM hardware remains usable)
