## What's this?
This is a performance-oriented, configurable gantry system for Voron 2.4 and Trident.

**Available drive configurations:**
- 2 stepper
- 4 stepper

**Available belt widths:**
- 6mm
- 9mm

**Available X-axis configurations:**
- Front rail (flipped belts, toothed side facing the X extrusion)
- Top rail

## What's the catch?
- You have to space out the front (4 stepper only) and rear panels on your printer by at least 5mm or have a 4040 frame.
- The tensioner range is half compared to stock. I can't recommend this for larger than 350mm builds.
- There's limited toolhead support currently.
- If you want to serialize your printer you have to build it stock first.
- This needs a Z chain relocation on V2.
- Trident top rail configs may need a bed relocation to get to the front of the bed (you can just move the PEI sheet for the same effect).
